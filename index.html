		<p> My name is Alexis Tapley. I am 20 years old, and I am a Junior at the University of Tennessee at Martin. I would like to pursue a career in video editing. I mostly make videos as a fun hobby these days, but I learned how to edit from the student news program at my high school, Munford High School in Tipton County. This initial important experience gave me the basic knowledge I needed to start making my own content. I find video editing very interesting because I see it as a puzzle. You piece together parts of videos and make a whole, satisfying project. I would like to work on movies, commercials, television shows, or as someone's personal video editor. I do not have very big dreams in life, I never have, but what I do desire for my future is very simple. I just want to be an editor who either works for home or in a small office in some average-sized city, living in an apartment with my pets and possibly my significant other. In achieving this, I think I will find much happiness in life. I believe it is possible for me to reach these small goals, especially with the right experience and skills to help me obtain a secure job and, by extension, a successful career. </p>
		<p> My strengths are writing, being creative, and being honest. I am a hard worker who is determined to get the job done correctly with as few attempts as possible for maximum efficiency. I have had great success so far in my school career, graduating with a 3.6 GPA in high school and maintaining a 3.3 GPA in college currently. I have never failed a course, nor have I ever been fired. I very rarely even fail a test or assignment. I have a bit of a perfectionism problem, but it is much better to be thorough than careless, I suppose. I am a very creative person. When faced with a problem, I can usually come with a novel solution very quickly. My past professors and teachers often complimented me on my academic skills, whether it be about writing, creativity, or general knowledge. That encouragement I received definitely had an impact on where I am today and why I have continued to pursue my educational experience by sticking with going to college. In my job experiences, I have always arrived to work on time, ready and willing to do what must be done that day during my shift. I may not have always been 100% chipper, but I did my best to put on a smiling face for those I interacted with. My honesty may be a bit of cause of trouble for me at times because, as the saying goes, the truth can and does hurt sometimes, but for the most part, honesty is something greatly valued by most people, so they appreciate my ability to state the facts, not sugarcoat things, and convey information in a truthful manner.  </p>
